**Research Paper-1**
  
   *A research paper is a piece of academic writing that provides analysis, interpretation, and argument based on in-depth independent research. It is a more formal and structured type of writing than an essay, and it typically requires more research and evidence.
In this documentation we're about to give research papers on the domain of speech and computer vision with a clear and concise thesis statement that states the main argument of the paper.*
